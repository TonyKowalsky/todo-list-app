# YeaPlanner

A simple, lightweight TODO list web application YeaPlanner built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
YeaPlanner is available at https://tonykowalsky.github.io/todo-list-app/

## Description

This app allows you to keep track of your tasks easily:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or not
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by status: all, completed, or in progress
- Tasks are saved in your browser's localStorage â€” so your list stays even after refreshing the page!

The app includes input validation and safe rendering to prevent HTML injection.

## Features

- Add tasks with a name
- Toggle tasks complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks from the list
- Filter to view all tasks, only completed, or only tasks in progress
- Displays counts of total and completed tasks
- Shows a "no tasks" message when the list is empty
- Data persistence via localStorage

## Technologies Used
